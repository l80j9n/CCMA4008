(b)   The bank would like to use an AI machine to shorten the waiting   time   to   enhance   the   service   provided.          The vendor claims that their AI   machine would shorten waiting times by   15% on   average after on-site testing in a bank.          Is it possible   to   have   the   average   waiting time   not   to   exceed 5 minutes?          Please state your   reason(s).

(i)                      The   8th      customer   entering   the   bank   and   every   20th      customer   thereafter   was   asked   to   indicate the number of credit cards in his/her wallet.
(ii)                   Researchers divided the customers into six groups according to gender (male or female)   and   monthly   income   group   (high,   medium   or   low).          2%    of   customers    from   each      group   were   selected   and   interviewed to   determine if he/she applied personal loan in the last year.

Question 2   (18 marks)
An   engineering program has   130   students who   are currently Year 2   students.             Only   13   students are
selected to participate in the overseas study   tour.
(a)             A   unique   number   is   assigned   to   each   of the    students,   from   001   to    130.          Suppose   the   candidate is   selected by   systematic   sampling method   and the   student with number   007   is   selected. Write down the next 3 student numbers who   are   selected to   join the   tour.
(b)          After   completing   the   study   tour,   they   are   required   to   submit   the   assignment   to   fulfil   the   graduation requirements.
The following are the results of   the assignment   (in marks):
54          22          25          23            36            43            7                  43            25            47            24            45            44
(i)                      Find the Q1,   Q2   ,   Q3    and   interquartile   range.
(ii)                   The passing mark of   this assignment is 40.            The   lecturer   would   like   to   adjust   each   student's   mark   so   that   half   of   them   would   pass   the   test.          Use      N      be   the   original mark (before adjustment) and    F    be the final mark (after adjustment).            If   the mark is   adjusted   by   the   formula    F    =   0.95N   +   a   ,   what   is   the   value    of    a      so   that   the   median   of   final   mark   is   40.
(iii)                Hence, find the Q1    and interquartile range of   final mark.
